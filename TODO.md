# TODO

- focus on questions regarding the playerbase
- e.g. where are the people mostly coming from that play on leaderboard X
- how many players are there overall
- what preferences do these players have
- how many games do people play in average
- are there groups of people that fit together, e.g. cohorts that play around the same amount of games on the ladders etc.
- i will not look into single match metadata
- maybe also something like when do people play games, is it more in the evening, how many are playing on the weekend etc.
